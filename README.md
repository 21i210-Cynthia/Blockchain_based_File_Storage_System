Blockchain-Based File Storage System
This repository contains a blockchain-based file storage system designed to offer a secure and decentralized solution for file storage and management. The system leverages blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, security, and decentralized access.

Features
Decentralized Storage: Files are distributed across multiple nodes to eliminate single points of failure.
Enhanced Security: Utilizes blockchain to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.
Efficient Retrieval: Provides mechanisms for quick and reliable file retrieval.

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (for the backend)
npm (Node package manager)
Ganache (for local blockchain network)
Metamask (for interacting with the blockchain through a web browser)
Steps
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/21i210-Cynthia/Blockchain_based_File_Storage_System.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd blockchain-based-file-storage
Install required libraries:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
Start server:
 python peer.py
Start a client:
 python run_app.py
Copy the link from the client terminal and paste it in any browser.

Usage
